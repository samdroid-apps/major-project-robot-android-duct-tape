# Engineering Robot Project

See the `arduino-project` folder for the microcontroller code.

This is an android application.  It houses both the code for the server (connected over USB) and the remote control app (connected over websockets).

This app included a copy of [usb-serial-for-android](https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android), which is a library for using USB Serial.  USB Serial for Android is not on gradle so is included in the usbSerialForAndroid folder.
